        <center>"This is Thanos we're talkin' about... he's the toughest there is." <br />―Rocket Raccoon to Thor
        </center>
    </p><br />
    <p>Thanos was an immensely powerful Titan, feared throughout the galaxy as one of the most powerful beings in the universe. He is able to easily outfight other powerful beings such as Thor and Hulk, and commands his Chitauri, Outrider, and Sakaaran legions
        unchallenged. The Confederacy, despite their combined strength, openly admitted that their forces could not face Thanos and said that even if Glenn Talbot, in his initial stages of having Gravitonium, were to join forces with the Avengers, he
        would still lose. When Nebula told Gamora that she planned to kill Thanos, Gamora stated that she didn't know if it was possible. Even Thor acknowledged that he needed Stormbreaker if he was to face Thanos, as fighting him without it would have
        been suicidal.</p>
    <h2>Powers</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Titan Physiology: Thanos possessed much of the same physical constitution and abilities from his extinct species. He possessed immense levels of superhuman strength, durability, and reflexes that allowed him to effortlessly overpower and injure
            similarly sized beings as strong as Hulk, but even smaller and incredibly powerful and super strong individuals as well, such as Thor, Vision, Loki, Spider-Man, Drax the Destroyer, Iron Man in his Mark L Armor and Captain America wielding
            Mjølnir.
        </p><br />
        <p>Superhuman Strength: Thanos managed to display incalculable levels of superhuman strength, being capable of lifting, moving or exerting millions of tons of force, such as quickly crushing the Tesseract to reveal the Space Stone, destroying Doctor
            Strange's magical shields with a kick, and easily lifting Loki and snapping his neck with a single hand. During the Battle of Wakanda, Thanos slammed Black Panther with enough force to cause his Panther Habit's nanites to overload with energy
            and expel a kinetic pulse, instantly broke out of Groot's vines with just a tug, and effortlessly overwhelmed Captain America with just a single hand, knocking him out with a punch. During the Battle of Titan, Thanos was able to easily punch
            Drax through several stones even with him blocking the attack with his knives, completely overpower Iron Man's Mark L armor, tearing away pieces of the armor with his bare hands and breaking out of any restraint put by Stark and upon waking
            from Mantis' forced slumber, Thanos was able to swat Mantis and Drax away and regain the Infinity Gauntlet from Spider-Man. While restrained by the hundreds of Eldritch Whips from Doctor Strange's replicas, Thanos was able to activate the
            Infinity Gauntlet to break free. Notably, Thanos was able to easily overpower Vision, lifting him with a single hand and swiftly ripping the Mind Stone from his body, tearing through the nearly indestructible vibranium housing with ease, and
            outmatched and severely beat both Thor and Hulk to a bloody pulp during his acquisition of the Tesseract. While fighting against Thor, Iron Man and Captain America, Thanos was able to kick Thor with enough force to break a concrete stone,
            throw Rogers away and easily lift Iron Man to block an oncoming strike Mjølnir. He effortlessly threw Thor against a group of stones, hit him repeatedly with enough force to make him bleed, and steadily overpowered Thor in a grapple with Stormbreaker,
            only being stopped from killing him by Captain America wielding and throwing Mjølnir at him. Once Captain America had stopped bombarding him from ranged attacks with the hammer, Thanos was able to easily slam him to the ground with enough
            force to hurt him and disarm him of the hammer with a single blow and even proved capable of using his Double-Edged Sword to break Captain America's nigh-indestructible shield with mere brute force, a testament of his titanic strength. Thanos
            was also able to easily break a Master of the Mystic Arts's magical shield with a single attack from his sword, cut through the immense amounts of debris launched by Scarlet Witch with a single strike, and briefly push her telekinetic defenses
            back before being eventually repelled and disarmed and launch his sword towards the quantum tunnel of Luis' van with enough velocity and force to destroy it before Captain Marvel could reach it. Thanos also instantly overpowered Iron Man in
            their struggle, punching him hard enough to temporarily incapacitate him firmly prevented Thor from using Stormbreaker against him with one hand while the Asgardian was using both hands and then held his attempts to decapitate him at bay when
            he used both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker still with just a single hand and eventually, by using both hands upon Captain America interfering to further drive Stormbreaker closer to his neck, he was able to stop Thor and knock him out with a headbutt
            before freeing himself from Rogers' grip and knocking out Captain America with a single punch when they tried to prevent him from taking the Nano Gauntlet. Thanos' strength also allowed him to fight with a fully-powered Captain Marvel, one
            of the most powerful beings in the universe, throwing the Kree-Human hybrid across the battlefield and managing to hold her off when she was using both hands for a while during their grapple for the Nano Gauntlet but was ultimately overpowered
            by her, with even a headbutt direct to her face having little effect, forcing him to use the Power Stone to defeat her.</p><br />
        <img src="thanos9.jpg" height="320px" width="500px" alt="" img style="float:right" />
        <p>Superhuman Durability: Thanos had tremendous levels of superhuman resilience and durability, rendering him to be highly durable. Indeed, he is capable of easily handling the Infinity Stones without being harmed, notably able to hold without any
            strain both the Space Stone and Power Stone in his hand, especially impressively suffering no harm from touching the Power Stone considering that it destroys almost anything organic that touches it and despite causing him some pain, the stone
            affect only his wrist and wielding the power of the Infinity Gauntlet without strain. Hence, when facing the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos was able to effortlessly catch bare-handed
            knife slashes from Drax and the sword strikes of Doctor Strange's magical sword without any signs of pain, shrug off blows from the superhumanly strong Spider-Man, and even colliding with a Necrocraft at full speed as well as having a massive
            pillar dropped on him did no damage on him, simply getting up and continuing to fight as if nothing happened. The repeated assaults of Iron Man's powerful Mark L Armor did nothing but slightly scratch his cheek which Thanos even mocked him
            for. Thanos also effortlessly shrugged off attacks from Captain America with no visible injury and surprise blows from Hulk similarly barely affected him at all. He was also able to shrug off energy attacks from Scarlet Witch, as well as a
            powerful lightning blast from Stormbreaker. Notably, he survived a blow to the chest from Stormbreaker even after Thor pushed on the axe to exacerbate the wound and was still resilient enough to survive using the full power of the Infinity
            Gauntlet to wipe out half the universe, though it did cause him to briefly enter a catatonic state and his durability was not enough to stop him from suffering severe burns across his face. Thanos himself mocked Thor for failing to target
            his head, indicating that such a blow is what it would take to kill him. Even after Thanos had been severely weakened by the destruction of the Infinity Stones, he remained durable enough to quickly recover from punches from Captain Marvel
            and Bruce wearing the Hulkbuster and also endure the pain of Thor cutting off his still Gauntlet coated hand until he was ultimately killed when Thor was finally able to decapitate him with his axe. The 2014 Thanos also waved off blows from
            the Mjølnir wielding Captain America and a full-powered Captain Marvel on two separate confrontations and also managed to survive being viciously attacked by an enraged Scarlet Witch long enough to order his forces to rain fire on the battlefield
            to stop her and take the combined blasts of Shuri's Vibranium Gauntlets, Wasp's blasters, and Pepper Potts's repulsors and swiftly recover to throw his sword to stop Captain Marvel.</p><br />
        <p>Superhuman Speed: Despite his size, Thanos could move at extraordinary superhuman speeds, being able to effortlessly overpower Hulk in hand-to-hand combat, easily dodging and countering all of his blows while simultaneously striking him multiple
            times, easily kick Thor aside after he had caught him off-guard and attacked him before he could attack him again and effortlessly grip Loki's neck before he could react moments after thwarting his assassination attempt. He was also able to
            easily punch aside Nebula after composing himself from her demands of Gamora's whereabouts and completely outmatch Iron Man's Mark L Armor in hand-to-hand combat, landing several vicious blows with Iron Man completely unable to defend himself,
            and after breaking the sword Iron Man attempted to stab him with, stab him with the piece before he could react, as well as easily punch Captain America before he could react while he was blocking Thanos' Gauntlet hand. The 2014 Thanos was
            able to punish the coordinated assault of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man with successful attacks that launched them several feet away, easily punch Captain America through stones, after being kicked by him, disarm Thor of Stormbreaker
            moments after he too was disarmed of his sword and pummel him after tossing him aside twice before he could recover and swiftly overwhelm Captain America armed with both Mjølnir and his shield in close combat, breaking through his guard and
            stabbing him in the leg and disarming him of the hammer before completely forcing Rogers into the defensive and soon tossing him aside after breaking his shield. He was also able to move faster towards the Nano Gauntlet than Iron Man despite
            Iron Man being closer, forcing Iron Man to tackle him instead, and swiftly stop Thor from reaching the Gauntlet despite having been pushed back by his onslaught just moments before.</p><br />
        <p>Superhuman Agility: Despite his giant size and vast muscle mass, Thanos moved with incredible agility in battle, being able to easily overcome the attacks of fast enemies like Thor and Captain America. Thanos was able to jump high from a piece
            of debris into the air to dodge Doctor Strange's fiery rays and then land perfectly on his feet without any problems.</p><br />
        <p>Superhuman Reflexes: Thanos, despite his size, possessed incredible superhuman reflexes, as he was able to effortlessly dodge and counter all of Hulk's blows upon composing himself after being briefly pummeled and easily reacted to Loki's swift
            attempt to kill him, effortlessly choking Loki to death before the latter could react. With just a single hand, Thanos was able to easily grab Gamora before she could strike him with Godslayer, and to even react to the extremely agile Spider-Man's
            attacks, eventually getting a grip on him and pinning Spider-Man down, as well as casually react to the highly agile Black Panther's full speed charge with a single hand. He also was able to easily catch Iron Man's Mark L Armor's sword and
            then break it and stab him with the piece before he could react. He could easily react to as well as outpace both Drax the Destroyer and Doctor Strange's moves even while his sight was hampered by web cotton and also managed to quickly overtake
            Nebula and deliver a powerful punch that sends her flying. While Thor was able to surprise and punched off a portion of Thanos' helmet, Thanos soon effortlessly kicked him away before he could react. Thanos was also able to easily react to
            the bullets of War Machine's Mark IV armor and Okoye's spear when she threw it at him, which allowed him to easily repel them with the Gauntlet's powers. He was also able to catch Stormbreaker in the air before Thor could use it against him.
            2014 Thanos even dodged the attack from Thor who tried to aim for Thanos' head while fighting Iron Man, Captain America and Thor at the same time and was able to avoid a swift lightning-empowered blow from Captain America wielding Mjølnir
            despite being knocked to the ground by the previous assaults and also catch Captain Marvel's hand before she could grab the Nano Gauntlet.</p><br />
        <img src="thanos10.jpg" height="157px" width="500px" alt="" img style="float:right" />
        <p>Superhuman Stamina: Thanos' musculature produces almost no fatigue toxins during physical activity. As a result, he could exert himself at peak capacity for a near indefinite period before poison toxins start to impair him. Throughout his quest
            to find all Infinity Stones, Thanos was able to fight the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and other opponents in both short and prolonged battles with no fatigue until his victorious decimation of half of all life. During the Battle of
            Earth, 2014 Thanos single-handedly fought against Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America as well as the rest of his opposers without any sign of fatigue and was only stopped by Iron Man's use of the Infinity Stones to wipe both him and his army
            out of existence.</p><br />
        <p>Regenerative Healing Factor: Thanos' physiology possessed a powerful regenerative healing factor, which allowed him to quickly regenerate from any of his wounds, regardless of severity or blood loss. Upon arriving on Earth, all of the minor wounds
            he had received at the hands of Tony Stark had completely disappeared. By the time he had killed off half of the universe's population via a completed Infinity Gauntlet and sat down to "admire the sunset," Thanos had completely regenerated
            from Thor using the Stormbreaker to severely cut his chest open, even though he was still exhausted from previous fights with the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, Thanos' healing factor was not enough to recover from the
            wounds dealt from destroying the Infinity Stones, which resulted in his body visibly half-burned and his arm thin and shriveled.</p><br />
        <p>Immortality: Thanos had lived for over a thousand years of age yet was still in his prime by the time of the Infinity War and the Battle of Earth during the 21st century.</p><br />
    </ul>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Genius-Level Intellect: Even at his youth, Thanos was deemed a genius among his kind. His long life allowed Thanos to refine his intellectual aptitude to the highest degree, making him quite possibly the most intelligent being in the universe.
            Thanos was even clever enough to easily outsmart Loki himself on more than one occasion, he was not only successful in using Loki as a pawn without the latter realizing it for a long time, but he was also able to successfully predict his attempt
            of assassination and countering it. Thanos also easily deceived the Guardians of the Galaxy into letting their guard down, thus allowing Thanos to incapacitate them and capture Gamora. Being highly intellectually and emotionally perceptive,
            Thanos can easily see right through most lies and accurately deduce the truth and the character of most people, as he effortlessly deduced that Loki was planning to assassinate him behind his worshiping of him from having known his deceptive
            and manipulative nature and instantly knew that Gamora was lying when she said she never found the Soul Stone. He even accurately predicted that Titan would be destroyed by overpopulation.</p><br />
        <p>Master Tactician: Thanos was an extraordinarily formidable strategist with centuries of experience in tactical warfare and leading huge armies. Even without using his immense powers and combat skills, Thanos successfully conquered many worlds
            through just his tactical expertise and leadership of his army. Thanos is also extraordinarily skilled in manipulation, as without leaving his throne, he was able to easily and effectively manipulate other powerful beings, such as Ronan the
            Accuser and even Loki himself, into doing his bidding, and his strategical ingenuity was shown by how he created extremely complex and well-coordinated plans and instructed his manipulated pawns into performing, with the strategies he created
            and employed being so effective that he gave the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy immense trouble by causing the Battle of Xandar and Chitauri Invasion all the while remaining effectively anonymous easily fooling even the most intelligent
            human beings on Earth such as Iron Man and Bruce Banner from figuring out Loki had been aided by Thanos in his invasion, and eluding Doctor Strange's list of otherworldly threats. It was only after Thor received a vision on the Infinity Stones
            that he was able to figure out Thanos' involvement, with Thor admitting that Thanos had been "playing a very intricate game," and has effectively used the Avengers as pawns without them even realizing it until Thor saw the vision. Thanos is
            even a far more superior tactician than Loki, who was famous for being a crafty genius in orchestrating cunning schemes, as he easily deceived the God of Mischief into becoming his minion and later easily predicted and outsmarted Loki's attempt
            to assassinate him. Thanos' strategical intuition also allows him to accurately predict incoming events and effectively manipulate said events to his advantage, as he was able to anticipate the Guardians going to Knowhere to retrieve the Reality
            Stone and arrived there before they could prevent him from taking it. Thanos even went as far as to set up a brilliant trap for the Guardians by casting an illusion to fool them into believing that he is still torturing the Collector for the
            Reality Stone while in actuality he had acquired the Reality Stone long before they arrived, all the while easily manipulating Gamora using illusions specifically seen in her mind to lure her into emotionally charging at Thanos, which worked
            to a great effect, catching Gamora and the Guardians completely off-guard, and allowing Thanos to successfully capture Gamora. Thanos can create effective strategies during combat, as he efficiently employed Titan's strong gravitational pull
            to separate much of his opponents by breaking and launching the pieces of Titan's moon at his enemies from the atmosphere and allowing Thanos to engage and overpower Doctor Strange and Iron Man, eventually culminating in Strange being forced
            to surrender the Time Stone to Thanos. Thanos can also swiftly think his way out of debilitating situations, as after Scarlet Witch destroyed the Mind Stone, Thanos was unfazed, due to now having the Time Stone, and swiftly reversed time before
            Vision's destruction while taking care as to not include the heroes in the time-reversal to prevent them from attempting to stop him, thus allowing Thanos to finally complete the Gauntlet and render Vision's sacrifice in vain. Even after Thor
            severely wounded him, Thanos was able to use Thor's vendetta against him to manipulate and fool him, as despite still being able to function enough to activate the completed Gauntlet, he let Thor vengefully gloat and attack him to convince
            him he was killing him before revealing that he will still live and can still accomplish his mission by mocking Thor for not aiming for his head, catching Thor off-guard and stunning him long enough that Thanos was able to snap his fingers
            before Thor could react. Before his death on the Garden, Thanos used the Infinity Stones' power against themselves to reduce them to atoms to prevent the Avengers from undoing the Snap, thereby securing his victory. The 2014 Thanos also displayed
            a similar aptitude for quickly forming strategies amid combat, as he swiftly came up with a plan to have 2014 Nebula impersonate her future self from 2023 and infiltrate the New Avengers Facility, providing a target for the Sanctuary II. He
            also instantly devised a plan to subdue the Scarlet Witch after getting overpowered by her by having his armies fire at both himself and her, successfully freeing himself, used his sword to destroy Luis' van to compensate his inability to
            get to Captain Marvel fast enough to prevent her from escaping, and when briefly overtaken by Captain Marvel, Thanos was able to tactically remove the Power Stone from the Gauntlet to use it against her, finally besting her. Thanos won all
            but one of the 14,000,605 outcomes of the Infinity War foreseen by Doctor Strange. Thanos, along with Helmut Zemo, was the only other strategist to defeat the Avengers.</p><br />
        <img src="thanos8.jpg" height="310px" width="500px" alt="" img style="float:right" />
        <p>Master Combatant: Thanos was an extraordinary warrior and hand-to-hand combatant, with a millennium's worth of fighting experience. Thanos' supreme combat skills supplemented by his physical prowess enable him to overpower even the strongest opponents.
            Under his tutelage, all of his adopted children, including Gamora herself, became extremely formidable fighters. He effortlessly beat Hulk to a bloody pulp, effortlessly restrained Gamora before she could react, swiftly overpowered both Doctor
            Strange using a sword made of Eldritch Magic and Drax the Destroyer with his knives, effortlessly slammed Spider-Man with only one hand, easily fought off and quickly defeated Nebula wielding her batons, and easily pummeled Iron Man in his
            Mark L armor. During the Attack on the Statesman, Thanos easily managed to single-handedly defeat and beat Thor. He even easily countered Black Panther's charge by choking him with a single hand and then pummeled him to the ground with a single
            punch, then knocked out Captain America with a single blow, despite the Avenger keeping Thanos occupied during the Battle of Wakanda. Only an attack from Thor using Stormbreaker was able to land a severe blow towards Thanos. Even without the
            incalculable powers from the Infinity Stones, the 2014 Thanos proved his extraordinary fighting skills alone made him nigh-unstoppable, as without the Infinity Gauntlet, he was able to easily overcome Thor, Captain America and Iron Man at
            the same time armed only with his sword, easily knocking off their initial attempts before defeating Iron Man and Captain America without any effort and effortlessly overcoming Thor with Stormbreaker quickly even after he had been disarmed
            of his sword. Although initially outmatched by Captain America using Mjølnir, Thanos was soon able to turn the tides against him by forcing him back and disarming him of the hammer, which resulted in Thanos to eventually overpower the Mjølnir-wielding
            Captain America. He later managed to simply fend off Thor, who was using both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker, as well as swiftly and effortlessly break free of Captain America's attempts to restrain him while also forcing back Thor.</p><br />
        <p>Sword Mastery: Thanos possessed extraordinary skill in the use of his double-bladed sword in battle, capable of easily fighting off coordinated assaults from Thor, Captain America and Iron Man, with him having been able to block Iron Man's repulsors
            when it was powered by Thor's lightning while simultaneously overcoming it and block an attack from Thor using Stormbreaker after just having thrown it and failed to hit him, although he got disarmed, as well as quickly overwhelm Captain America
            armed with both Mjølnir and his shield and stab his leg before entirely dominating him and destroying his shield. Thanos also was able to face Scarlet Witch with it, having managed to easily cut through the projectiles she launched at him
            as well as block her energy shots and nearly managed to defeat her, pushing down on her with his sword, thereby forcing her to use her powers to disarm him. Thanos was also able to throw it with such skill as to achieve a boomerang-like effect.
            His precision was enough to be able to hit and knock down Black Panther when the latter was moving at super speeds as well as explode Luis' van to prevent Captain Marvel from escaping with the gauntlet. Thanos also readily used Corvus Glaive's
            glaive to impale and kill Heimdall.</p><br />
