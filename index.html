        <p>Thanos was a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose own main objective was to bring stability to the universe, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and condemn this. To complete this
            goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, as the combined efforts might wipe out half the universe. Thanos forged alliances with Loki, and Ronan the Accuser, in order to track down some of the Stones: However, both alliances
            cost Thanos much of his resources, including the Mind Stone and the loyalty of his daughters, Gamora and Nebula. Fed up with all his subordinates' ongoing failures, Thanos then forced Eitri to create the Infinity Gauntlet for him, while Thanos
            had opted to seek out the location of the six Infinity Stones himself.</p>

        <p>Thanos engaged in a ferocious crusade, in order to obtain the Infinity Stones. During his mission, both Thanos and his Black Order invaded multiple planets and slaughtered thousands to gain the stones, including Loki and the Asgardians. This quest
            even forced Thanos to sacrifice his beloved Gamora, in order to take the Soul Stone. Thanos soon found himself challenged by the alliances of the entire universe's greatest heroes, which included the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However,
            despite facing off against the powerfully combined opposition and the wrath of Thor, Thanos still ultimately triumphed as he completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using it to finally complete his goal and had caused the Snap, which resulted in
            half of all life in the universe being wiped out at the snap from his fingers.</p>
        <p>Following his Snap, Thanos had then ensured this could never be reversed by destroying all of the Infinity Stones, resulting in the Avengers tracking him down on Garden before then being decapitated by Thor. However, in the alternative 2014, Thanos
            was alerted to the events of the Infinity War by a time-traveled Nebula, resulting in him traveling to 2023 and laying siege on the Avengers, as he had just decided to instead wipe out the entire universe and replace it out of revenge for
            their efforts to stop him. However, Thanos had been just too late to stop the Snap from being reversed as thousands of heroes returned to stop him. Despite all of Thanos' best efforts, he was unable to claim victory as Tony Stark used his
            armor to utilize the Infinity Stones, and had decimated the Chitauri and Outriders, as well as Thanos himself, finally ending his reign once and for all.</p>
